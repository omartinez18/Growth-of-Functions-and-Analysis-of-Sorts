# Analysis-of-Sorts
This assignment is an exercise in implementing some of the sorting algorithms we have been discussing, and an opportunity to conduct some timing tests in order to gather empirical data about the amount of time different sorts take on different amounts of data.
Sorting functions that are implemented: InsertionSort(), MergeSort() and QuickSort(). Every sorting method sorts by both name and population providing seperate input times for either method.
CENSUS2010POP.csv is an input file that contains 81,746 records of cities and their population. Sorting methods sort by name and by population size. Once you have implemented and tested the sort functions, a series of tests are ran on files of different sizes and collect and graph the timing data.
